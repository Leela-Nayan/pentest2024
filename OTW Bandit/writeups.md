# Level 0

Well I already knew how to ssh, but since they mentioned port number, I didn't know the argument (yeah, i guessed it'd most likely be -p), so I looked at the man page and just gave the -p arg and got on with it.

# Level0-1

Used the commands ls to list all the files in the home directory and then used "cat readme" (name of the file was readme), to print its contents.

# level1-2

Again, similar to the previous level, used ls command to find the file named "-" and I used cat - and it didn't work out, then I saw the resource mentioned in for dashed filenames, and found out you have to use cat./- for special characters.

# level2-3

This level was also similar/same as we just had to put the file name in quotations in cat command as the file name had spaces in it.

# level 3-4

In this level, after using the cd command and changing directory to the "inhere" directory, I used the manpage of ls to find the arguement for showing all files. Then ran the command ls -a to find the file and used cat command again to print its contents.

# level 4-5

For this level though, I used some of my prior knowledge. I had tinkered around a lot with a raspi, so I knew this already. To find the human readable file, it was just file ./* which would print the data types of all the files in the current directory. from there, it was only one file with ascii text, so I just printed its contents using cat ./-file07, which also again prints all the contents inside the file07.

# level5-6

For this level, I started reading the man page for finding the arguments for the given conditions, and I found the size arguement. So I just ran the command with only the size argument and to my luck, there was only one file.

Commands used:  find -size 1033c,  cat ./maybehere07/.file2

# level 6-7

This one took me a bit of a time, because I had to read the man page of find for all the arguments and even after writing the command, I got a lot of results. I was dumbfounded and was just randomly scrolling through all the hits when I saw only one file did not have "Permission denied" and that one file conveniently also had the name "bandit7.password", so I just used the cat command next and printed its contents.

Commands Used: find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c, 
               cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password

# level 7-8

As soon as I read this challenge, I knew exactly what I had to do because of my prior knowledge again and my preference to use nano as my text editor over vim. I just used nano data.txt and then used ctrl+w to use the "find" feature. 

Commands used: nano data.txt, ctrl+w > millionth

# level 8-9

This level was also pretty easy as we just had to use the sort command and I already knew the argument.

Commands used: sort data.txt | uniq -c

# level 9-10

At first, I tried to use the nano editor and the "find" option in that, but that didn't work out I have no idea why. Then I read the "commands you may need to solve this level" and started to go through the man pages of every command listed there. I just saw the first line of man page of strings and knew this would work, because it would print only the printable characters of the txt file, so i just ran strings data.txt and voila, I just scrolled up a bit and found the password. But maybe, I could've also used a combination of grep (current thought, didn't occur at that time), would have been easier.

Commnands used: strings data.txt

# level 10-11

This level was also direct. I just had to look at the manpage of base64 and figure out the right way to arguments (looking back at it now, I don't even know why I wrote the wrong commands).

Commands used: base64 -d data.txt

# level 11-12

Oh man, this level literally took up all of my brain cells. I had to get help from 2 seniors to get this done. I think out of all the 22 levels I've done, this might have been the longest I've ever took to complete a level. I read the manpage of tr command and thought I did everything correctly, but the logic I missed was second half of alphabets' reverse collating order. That took me time.

Commands used: cat data.txt | tr [a-z][A-Z] [n-za-m][N-ZA-M]

# level 12-13

Even in this level, I had problems with making the temp directory, so had to get help from a senior again. But apart from that, this was the longest level, but it was easy only for the most part. I just had to look at the file type, then see the manpage for that file type and uncompress it and repeat that process over and over, dozens of times.

Commands used: (Yeah, its better I just attach the screenshots instead of typing them again here)

# level 13-14

1. Used the ls command and found the ssh key.
2. Used nano and opened the key, and copied.
3. On my local machine, used nano to create a new file and pasted the ssh key into it.
4. Then went through the man page of ssh and found the arguement was -i, so did ssh -i /home/Desktop/nayan/sshkey bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220. Got a wrong permissions error for the ssh key.
5. I knew I had to use the chmod command, but didn't know the arguments, so I used the manpage of ssh, and then used chmod u=rwx sshkey
6. Now i reran the command and logged into level14.
7. Next i directly ran cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and got the password.

# level 14-15

1. So yet again, I was clueless as to how send inputs to a port on localhost, so I started reading the man pages of all the commands listed in "Commands you may need to solve this level". Read telnet first, then read nc and found that this was the command needed.

2. Then ran the command nc localhost 30000, sent this level's password and it returned next level's password.
